## Suggested Language Combination

Since Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's language files are divided into separate language packs:
- **Latin-Based Font Pack** ‚Äì Does not include any Asian language characters.
- **Chinese Simplified Pack** ‚Äì Includes Simplified Chinese and part of Latin letters.
- **Chinese Traditional Pack** ‚Äì Includes Traditional Chinese and part of Latin letters.
- **Japanese Pack** ‚Äì Includes Japanese and part of Latin letters.
- **Korean Pack** ‚Äì Includes Korean and part of Latin letters.

The game determines which language pack to load based on the language setting in the game options. Therefore, if the language chosen for dual subtitles is not included in the loaded language pack, it will not be displayed in the game. As a result, the following combinations are recommended:
- Latin-based (e.g., English) ‚Üí Latin-based (e.g., French) ‚úÖ Works fine.
- Asian-based (e.g., Chinese) ‚Üí English ‚úÖ Works fine.
- Asian-based (e.g., Chinese) ‚Üí Russian ‚ö† Some characters missing.
- Latin-based (e.g., English) ‚Üí Asian-based (e.g., Chinese) ‚ùå Most Asian characters missing.
- Asian-based (e.g., Simplified Chinese) ‚Üí Asian-based (e.g., Japanese) ‚ùå Even though both are Asian languages, their fonts are not shared.
